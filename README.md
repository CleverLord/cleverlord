## I am 3nd year student of Computer Science and Smart Systems

After years of self-learning Unity 3D and making lot's of educational projects (this is my excuse for doing only the hard part in the projects and abandoning them preety much forever :) ) I made a great tool, that I believe should be a great base for any hexagonal project. During development I was focused not on many feaures, but on crating functions any developer could ever need from this system.

I also used this account to hand in my project for Graph Teory. It includes algorithms like
  - path coloring
  - vertices coloring
  - determining Hammiltons' property
  - determinign Eulers' property
  - A*
  - brute forced (if even finished) searching for planarity of the graph
